/ModelValidator 
================
The [ModelValidator](/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/bives/algorithm//ModelValidator.java) (jdoc) is a tool meant to validate models for their applicability in /BiVeS. Since /BivesSupportsMoreThanAllowed models that are not valid in terms of the specification of their markup language are valid for /BiVeS and, thus, you shouldn't rely on the validator.
