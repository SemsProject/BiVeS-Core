ModelValidator 
================

The [ModelValidator](https://github.com/SemsProject/BiVeS-Core/tree/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/bives/algorithm/ModelValidator.java) is a tool meant to validate models for their applicability in BiVeS. Since [BiVeS supports more than allowed](BivesSupportsMoreThanAllowed) models that are not valid in terms of the specification of their markup language are valid for BiVeS and, thus, you shouldn't rely on the validator.
