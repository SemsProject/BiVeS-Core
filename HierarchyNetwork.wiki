= HierarchyNetwork =
* representing a graphical hierarchy network, intended to visualize CellML hierarchical dependencies of components
* contains components which may contain variables
* there may be directed connections from parent components to child components representing the hierarchy among components
* variables can be connected visualizing the flow of information between them

== create a HierarchyNetwork ==
TODO

== export a HierarchyNetwork ==
* API contains functionality to export a HierarchyNetwork to different graph formats:
 * GraphML, e.g. to use it with [http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/ CytoscapeWeb] -- see also GraphmlFormatDescription
 * DOT, e.g. to use it with GraphViz -- see also DotFormatDescription
 * JSON, e.g. to use it with [http://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape.js/ CytoscapeJS] -- see also JsonGraphFormatDescription

== Modifications ==
* a HierarchyNetworkComponent may report following modifications:
 * GraphEntity.MODIFIED: properties of this component have changed, or its parental association in the corresponding hierarchy was modified.
 * GraphEntity.INSERT: this component wasn't present in the original document, but was inserted in the modified version
 * GraphEntity.DELETE: this component isn't present in the modified version, while it was present in the original document
 * GraphEntity.UNMODIFIED: component and its parental association in the component hierarchy hasn't changed (variables in this component may have been inserted/deleted/modified)

* a HierarchyNetworkVariable may report following modifications:
 * GraphEntity.MODIFIED: its label has changed, or some other properties were modified
 * GraphEntity.INSERT: it wasn't present in the original document
 * GraphEntity.DELETE: it isn't present in the modified document anymore
 * GraphEntity.UNMODIFIED: same properties in both the original and the modified document
